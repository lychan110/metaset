### About the 3D Data

We provide two versions of our 3D data, one from our conference paper in _IDETC 2020_, and from our journal paper in _JMD_. In _JMD_, we filtered our dataset to include only families with a wider range of structurally feasible unit cells. Both were selected using the Hausdorff distance for shape similarity. Please see the sections below and our papers for more details.

- 3D diverse unit cell families:
  - Size of subsets: 10
  - Formats: PNG, STL, level-set functions
  - Options:
    - One sample (median unit cell) per family is provided here.
    - 100 samples per family are available at [this link for 2020_IDETC](https://northwestern.box.com/s/l3prbvm90ou0idp1s117mk7cj9ilxb6j). The zip archive of 3,000 STL files is ~930MB. If the link does not work, please contact weichen (at) northwestern (dot) edu. (Will be available for `2020_JMD` in the future.)
    - A PDF file containing the level-set functions (and crystallographic information) used to generate each family is also available. More samples can be generated from the level-set functions. (Will be available for `2020_JMD` in the future.)

- _Errata:_ An error during the data generation stage caused some unit cells to become "off-center", i.e., not symmetric. A few PNG and STL may be incorrect, but the level-set functions are accurate. This is fixed in the `2020_JMD` data set.

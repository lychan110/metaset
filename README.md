## METASET: An automated data selection method for scalable data-driven design of metamaterials

This repository contains the data of shape and property diverse subsets of linear elastic meechanical metamaterial unit cells in both 2D and 3D. In our paper, we demonstrated that a smaller yet diverse set of unit cells can lead to scalable search and unbiased learning. To select such subsets, we proposed METASET, a methodology that uses similarity metrics to jointly measure the diversity of unit cells in both shape and property space using Determinantal Point Processes and an efficient, greedy subset selection algorithm. Our diverse datasets can be directly used by metamaterials designers, especially in data-driven design or, in the 3D case, design of functionally graded materials.

## METASET: Exploring Shape and Property Spaces for Data-Driven Metamaterials Design

This repository contains the **data of shape and property diverse subsets of metamaterial unit cells** autonomously selected by METASET, a methodology that uses similarity metrics to jointly measure the diversity of unit cells in both shape and property space through Determinantal Point Processes and an efficient, greedy subset selection algorithm. In our papers, we demonstrated that a smaller yet diverse set of unit cells can lead to scalable search and unbiased learning. Our diverse datasets can be directly used by metamaterials designers, especially in data-driven design or, in the 3D case, design of functionally graded materials.

### About the Data

  - Sizes of subsets: 20, 100
  - Formats: PNG, TXT of binary images.
  - See [./2D_diverse/README](https://github.com/lychan110/metaset/tree/master/2D_diverse) for more information.
- 3D diverse unit cell families:
  - Size of subsets: 10
  - Formats: PNG, STL, level-set functions
  - See [./3D_diverse/README](https://github.com/lychan110/metaset/tree/master/3D_diverse) for more information.
